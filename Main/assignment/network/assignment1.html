            <p>
                How long does it take a packet of length 1,000 bytes to propagate over a link of distance 2,500 km, propagation speed 2.5 · 10 8 m/s, and transmission rate 2 Mbps? More generally, how long does it take a packet of length L to propagate over a link of distance d, propagation speed s, and transmission rate R bps? Does this delay depend on packet length? Does this delay depend on transmission rate?
            </p>

            <p>
                The time T for a file to go threw this link if : T = L / R. So for this file it will take 1/2.10**-7s if we consider that 2 Mbps is equal to 2.10**10 bps.

                Consider a packet of length L which begins at end system A and travels over three links to a destination end system. These three links are connected by two packet switches. Let d<SUB>i</SUB>, s<SUB>i</SUB>, and R<SUB>i</SUB> denote the length, propagation speed, and the transmission rate of link i, for i = 1, 2, 3. The packet switch delays each packet by d<SUB>proc</SUB> . Assuming no queuing delays, in terms of d<SUB>i</SUB>, s<SUB>i</SUB>, R<SUB>i</SUB>, (i = 1,2,3), and L, what is the total end-to-end delay for the packet? Suppose now the packet is 1,500 bytes, the propagation speed on all three links is 2.5 · 10 8 m/s, the transmission rates of all three links are 2 Mbps, the packet switch processing delay is 3 msec, the length of the first link is 5,000 km, the length of the second link is 4,000 km, and the length of the last link is 1,000 km. For these values, what is the end-to-end delay?
