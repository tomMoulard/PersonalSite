Compute the EstimatedRTT after each of these SampleRTT values is obtained, using a value of α = 0.125 and assuming that the value of EstimatedRTT was 100 ms just before the first of these five samples were obtained. Compute also the DevRTT after each sample is obtained, assuming a value of β = 0.25 and assuming the value of DevRTT was 5 ms just before the first of these five samples was obtained. Last, compute the TCP TimeoutInterval after each of these samples is obtained.

            <p>
                Recall the macroscopic description of TCP throughput. In the period of time from when the connection’s rate varies from W/(2 · RTT) to W/RTT, only one packet is lost (at the very end of the period). a. Show that the loss rate (fraction of packets lost) is equal to
                <!-- L -->
                b. Use the result above to show that if a connection has loss rate L, then its average rate is approximately given by
                <!-- average loss rate  -->
