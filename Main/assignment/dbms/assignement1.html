        <h1>Part One</h1>
        <p>
            <h4>Question One : Tell the difference and association between DBS and File-Based system.</h4>
            The main difference between these two system is how they store the data. DBS uses FBS to store and retrieve data. DBS also provide a lots of features to manage data that FBS does not have.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Two : Give the features of DBS.</h4>
            There is a few features useful in DBS. Indexing data is one of them, the purpose of this is to make a few links between files to sort them and establish connexion in the data of this database or even in different databases. One other feature is the safety of data, there is a lot of options with it, you can replicate your data in different places at the same time. DBS is also great for a concurrency usage of data : The access of the same data at the same time is now possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Three : Describe the ANSI-SPARC three-level architecture of DBS, what are the advantages of this architecture ?</h4>
            This architecture is divided in three levels :</br>
            The External Level, It allow users to view a part of the database that is relevant to him, and forbids the user to see an unauthorized file.</br>
            The Conceptual Level, a useful level to see the whole database without constraints and show the inter-connection of data. But this level does not explain how the data is stored physically.</br>
            And then The Internal Level, represent how the physic database is managed.</br>
            There is a few advantages to use a ANSI-SPARC three-level architecture, like different user view depending of the user, and the user does not have to know how the data is managed. Moreover, the DBAdmin can change storage structures without affecting the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Four : What is Data Independence(DI) ?</h4>
            The Data Independence is a way to express data in a level of abstraction that allows data in others level to be changed without being a constraint for this data. You can therefore change the structure of the database without affecting a good usage for a program or a user.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Five : What are Logical Data Independence (LDI) and Physical Data Independence (PDI) respectively ?</h4>
            These two level of DI can change both level of schema, the logical schema for the LDI and physical schema for the PDI. Except that it only changes its own level.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Six : What is a Data Model ?</h4>
            The data model define the the structure of the data, it's manipulations and integrity aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Seven : What is Conceptual Model ?</h4>
            The Conceptual Model is a representation of a system. It merge different concept to generalize a process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question height : Write the function and components of Data Model.</h4>
            The Data model is used to organize elements of data and to standardize how they relates to one another.
            It is defined by three main components :<br />
            Structure, a collection of data structure used to create the database.<br />
            Integrity, a collection of rules to ensure a structural integrity among data structures.<br />
            Manipulation, a collection operators used to manipulate data structures like query informations and update it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Nine : Why can DBS provide Data Independence(DI) ?</h4>
            Thanks to his level of abstraction, the DBS allow different users a Data Independence by using the different level of DI, LDI and PDI.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Question Ten : Tell the association and difference (Connection) between Conceptual Schema and Conceptual Model</h4>
            The difference between the Conceptual Schema and Conceptual Model is the level of abstraction between them. The schema is used to describe the whole system composed by different models.
