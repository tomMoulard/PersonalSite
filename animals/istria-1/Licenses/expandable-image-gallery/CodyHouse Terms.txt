Terms

All resources available on CodyHouse can be used freely in both personal and client projects. You don’t have to link back to us but we always appreciate credit.

You are not allowed to take our work “as-is” and redistribute or sell it somewhere else.

Make sure to respect the licenses of any additional resources (e.g. plugins, images…) we may include in our source files.

If you write about our resources, we would appreciate a link back to the original articles. You are free to copy excerpts but do not copy entire articles.

If you develop free plugins,templates, etc. out of our resources, please credit us and link to the respective article on CodyHouse.

Don’t re-publish our demos and our ZIP files, and don’t link directly to any ZIP file, link to the article instead.
Extended License

Our resources can be used in products offered for sale (e.g. on marketplaces like Themeforest and Creative Market). However you have to buy an extended license of the resource.

Our resources have to be part of a more complex work (e.g. you cannot sell a “pluginized” version of our resources).

1 extended license gives you the right to use 1 resource in a single product for sale. If you want to use more resources, you have to buy an extended license for each one of them. If you want to use the same resource in different products for sale, you have to buy an extended license for each one of your products.

License cost is $50/resource. There’s no time limitation, once you buy a license for a product, you can use it for as long as you want.

We constantly update our resources and we try to answer all comments/emails from our community. Be aware that extended licenses don’t come with premium support. We’re not responsible if one of our resources causes your product to break. Feel free to download the resource and test it before deciding to purchase the extended license.
